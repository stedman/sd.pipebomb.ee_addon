h3. Common usage

@{exp:pipebomb switch="{dynamic_variable}" cases="1|2|3|4" values="Number One|Number Two|Number Three|Number Four"}@

In the example above, if the dynamic variable is 3, then "Number Three" shall be returned.

h3. Switch on ExpressionEngine cookies

@{exp:pipebomb switch="language" switch_type="cookie" cases="|_es|_pg" values="Display English|Indicar Español|Mostrar Português"}@

If you need to get a cookie variable set by ExpressionEngine, set the switch_type to "cookie" and enter the cookie name in the switch parameter.

* switch_type="cookie": [OPTIONAL] to get the value of an ExpressionEngine cookie (the value of "switch" should be the cookie name)
* cases: the piped fields for the "switch" to match
